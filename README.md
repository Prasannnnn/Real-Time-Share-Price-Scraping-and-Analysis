# Real-Time-Share-Price-Scraping-and-Analysis üìä

This project is a **Real-Time-Share-Price-Scraping-and-Analysis** built using **Streamlit**, **BeautifulSoup**, and **Pandas**. It allows users to input a stock symbol and retrieve financial data along with a sentiment recommendation (BUY, SELL, or HOLD). The sentiment is based on key financial indicators like **P/E ratio**, **ROCE**, **ROE**, **Dividend Yield**, and more.

## Features

- Scrapes financial data of stocks from [Screener.in](https://www.screener.in/).
- Analyzes the stock's fundamentals such as **Market Cap**, **Stock P/E**, **Dividend Yield**, **ROCE**, **ROE**, and **52-Week High/Low**.
- Provides recommendations: **BUY**, **SELL**, **HOLD**, or **WAIT**, based on the sentiment derived from financial indicators.
- Simple and interactive user interface built with **Streamlit**.

## How It Works

1. **User Input**: The user enters a stock symbol (e.g., TCS, RELIANCE, INFY) in the input field.
2. **Data Scraping**: The application scrapes financial data from the stock's page on **Screener.in**.
3. **Data Extraction**: The key financial values (Market Cap, Stock P/E, etc.) are extracted from the page using **BeautifulSoup**.
4. **Sentiment Analysis**: Based on predefined conditions, the stock is categorized as:
   - ‚úÖ **BUY** (Good Fundamentals)
   - ‚è≥ **WAIT** (Too Expensive)
   - üìâ **BUY** (Undervalued)
   - üí∞ **BUY** (Good for Dividends)
   - ‚ùå **SELL** (Overvalued)
   - ü§î **HOLD** (Needs Further Analysis)
5. **Result Display**: The user gets a summary of the stock's financial data and the sentiment recommendation.
